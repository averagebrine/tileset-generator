# Tileset Generator

A simple python script that uses a template image including basic edges and corners and extrapolates from them to create a tileset that includes all possible tiles.

To use, first edit `template.png` to look how you'd like. The template contains one full tile, edges, corners, and inner corners. Make sure these tile nicely.

Next, just run `tileset_gen.py`. Assuming you kept the template in the same location as the script and .json, it will generate the full tileset for you. That's it!
